# Pin-Games

## Game 1: Bowling

### Controls
Up/Left/Down/Right or W/A/S/D for moving forward, left, backwards, and right. 
Q to quit the game. 
R to restart. 
S/Z for slow mode. 
1/2 to load game 1 or game 2.

### Gameplay
You control a bowling ball on a platform leading to a bunch of pins. Your goal is to knock all the pins down within the alloted 10 seconds. Doing so will earn you a victory. Failing to do so will cause you to fail. You will want to make sure not to fall off the platform or fly off the map.

## Game 2: Pin Chaser

### Controls
Left/Right or A/D for turning left and right. 
Q to quit the game. 
R to restart. 
S/Z for slow mode. 
1/2 to load game 1 or game 2.

### Gameplay
You are to traverse the path and attempt to make it to the end without getting caught by the horde. You will want to turn at paths, but need to be precise with the timing. If you turn before you reach a platform where turning is possible, or if you turn after the midpoint of a platform where turning is possible, you will suffer a speed penalty. The pins will follow you on the path, but may become erratic at any given time, flying off the path and making the game harder and more terrifying.

### Additional Info
The pins have a mode called "Woke Mode". After some time, the bunnies may become enraged and empowered, going off the path to chase you with a fiery aura. This makes the mode much more interesting and challenging. The cameras linger a bit behind the ball and readjusts its angles a lot more snappy than the implementation. The first camera feature gives the feeling of traveling fast and coming to a quick halt, and the second feature makes it easier to do sharp turns and less awkward. There are many background elements.
